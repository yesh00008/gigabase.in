   - Cache hit rate
   - Algorithm accuracy
   - Result diversity

2. **User Engagement**
   - Search queries per user
   - Points earned
   - Achievements unlocked
   - Study groups created

3. **Technical Health**
   - Page load time
   - Bundle size
   - Error rate
   - Uptime

4. **Feature Usage**
   - Most used algorithms
   - Popular content sources
   - Active collaboration sessions

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

### Bundle Size Warning
```
(!) Some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification.
```

**Impact**: Low - Gzipped size is only 357 KB  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Solution**: Consider code splitting in future update  
**Status**: Acceptable for v2.0

### Potential Improvements
1. **Code Splitting**: Dynamic imports for algorithms
2. **Lazy Loading**: Load features on demand
3. **Service Worker**: Offline support
4. **Image Optimization**: Compress assets
5. **CDN**: Serve static assets from CDN

**Status**: Deferred to v2.1
