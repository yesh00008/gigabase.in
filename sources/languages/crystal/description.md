Like [Julia][1], [Crystal][2] is another open-source language with a nice Wikipedia 
page, so we'll be using that to get some language background.

According to [Wikipedia][2], Crystal is a general-purpose language that first 
appeared in 2014. As of today, Crystal is self-hosted meaning the compiler 
is written in an earlier version of Crystal.

That said, Crystal was inspired by [Ruby][3] which is the language Crystal was 
originally written in. However, as previously mentioned, Crystal is a compiled 
language, so many of the dynamic features of Ruby no longer exist.

Despite the lack of dynamic features, Crystal leverages strong type inference 
to allow for implicit typing. As a result, the language looks like a high-level 
scripting language. However, the language's efficiency is much closer to 
lower-level languages like C.
