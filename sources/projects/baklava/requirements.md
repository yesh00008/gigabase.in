For simplicity, Baklava requires no inputs and can be executed in some form as follows:

```console
$ ./baklava.lang
```

The following is the expected output:

               *
              ***
             *****
            *******
           *********
          ***********
         *************
        ***************
       *****************
      *******************
     *********************
      *******************
       *****************
        ***************
         *************
          ***********
           *********
            *******
             *****
              ***
               *

1.  The shape should be symmetrical both horizontally and vertically
2.  Each subsequent line should either add or remove padding by one character on both sides
3.  Whitespace should be adjusted accordingly in order to properly output the shape
