[Java][1] is a general-purpose language that was designed with 
portability in mind. In other words, compile once and run anywhere. Originally called 
Oak, Java was developed in 1991 where the syntax was largely influenced by [C][2]/[C++][3].

Today, Java exists as one of the most popular languages in the industry with uses 
that range from database management to app development. Since its inception, Java has 
gone through nine iterations and two companies: [Sun Microsystems][4] and [Oracle Corporation][4],
the current owners.

As a language, Java has received several [complaints][6]. For instance, many developers 
despise Java for its verbosity and performance. That said, the language has many
great features like garbage collection which offset some of these complaints.
