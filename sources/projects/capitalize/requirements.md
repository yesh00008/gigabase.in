For this sample program, each solution should return the string with the first letter in uppercase.
For example, the following code should return "Capitalize":

```console
$ ./capitalize.lang "capitalize"
Capitalize
```

Here are some additional examples:

```
string -> String
react -> React
java -> Java
car -> Car
a long string term -> A long string term
```

In addition, there should be some error handling for situations where the user
doesn't input a string.
